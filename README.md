```bash
yarn install
# Or just
yarn
```

##### Create symlink
Run the following command on package root folder, so you can consume on an app locally

```bash
yarn link
```

##### Watch project
Build package whenever there is a change
```bash
yarn watch
```

##### Consume the package

```bash
yarn link @2600hz/commland-dielectric-js-sdk
```

Components library uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) - Strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Allows execute javascript scripts on the terminal
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) - Open source native runtime to build web native apps.

- **docs** - for updates to the documentation
- **BREAKING CHANGE** - regardless of type, indicates a Major release (MAJOR) ex. v1.0.0
